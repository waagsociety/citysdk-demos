<h3>Translating data into accessible information</h3>
Citizens and (government) agencies create and collect a lot of data, which they are now opening up for reuse more and more. This dashboard makes use of the latest open data from a wide range of municipal services. The web service CitySDK has a big role in this by standardizing the data at a European level. Besides that it makes the information searchable and available on demand, enabling developers to create application such as this dashboard.

<h3>How to use the City Dashboard</h3>
A city consists of many elements, shown on this dashboard as the following domains: transport, environment, statistics, economy, social, cultural & security. For each domain, the actual status is shown, based on blocks of 24 hours. The data is refreshed every 10 seconds. The information is captured in charts, graphs and on a map of the city. Larger dots and darker colors symbolize higher values and vice versa. On the map, you can choose which layers you want to see: from only one domain to interesting combinations and all of them together. Personalize what you are seeing and try to discover the city of Amsterdam on a whole new level!

<h3>No data available?</h3>
We aim to display all the numbers, graphics and other results in this City Dashboard as readable as possible. Since this platform collects data from different kind of sources that otherwise are stored in multiple databases, it may happen that particular data isn't available for a moment. In that case the data source is interrupted.
