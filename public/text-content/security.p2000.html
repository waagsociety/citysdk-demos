	The domain security shows actions of for instance the police, ambulance and fire fighters: events. An ‘event’ can be anything for which one of these parties becomes active. The chart shows the number of events during the day. On the map you can also see what kind of event took place: whether it was a call for an ambulance or for the police for instance.
