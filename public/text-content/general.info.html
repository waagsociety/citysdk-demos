Welcome to the City Dashboard! This platform shows you what is going on in Amsterdam at this moment. No interpretations, just the pure facts & figures. What is the average speed of traffic in the city? How many cultural events are going on? What are the levels of noise and what are people tweeting about? The dashboard visualizes this information. Play and experiment with it, make different combinations and get to know the city real-time!

Citizens and (government) agencies create and collect a lot of data, which they are now opening up for reuse more and more. This dashboard makes use of this open data. The data comes from different sources, but is all stored on the platform CitySDK. CitySDK standardizes the data at a European level and makes the information searchable and available on demand, enabling developers to create application such as this dashboard.

A city consists of many elements, shown on this dashboard as domains: transport, environment, statistics, economy, social, cultural & security. For each domain, the actual status is shown, based on blocks of 24 hours. The data is refreshed every 10 seconds. The information is captured in charts, graphs and on a map of the city. Larger dots and darker colours symbolize higher values and vice versa. On the map, you can choose which layers you want to see: only one domain, interesting combinations or all of them together. Personalize what you are seeing!
