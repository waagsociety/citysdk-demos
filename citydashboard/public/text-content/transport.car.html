For car traffic, the platform shows the average speed (Avg. Speed) that cars are driving at this moment. The figures for ‘road pressure’ tell us how accessible the city is. For example: a percentage of 100 means that the network of roads is used optimally: you can drive as fast as the maximum speed on that road allows you to – no traffic jams or roadblocks. The lower the percentage, the less traffic. Finally, ‘Parking’ shows you the percentage of parking spots that are in use at this moment.
