What is the quality of the air in Amsterdam like? To show this, we use two sources. The information on the left comes from a growing network of Smart Citizen Kits: DIY-measurement kits that tell us something about nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, noise level and light. 100 people in the city have signed up for a kit, which are distributed by Waag Society and Amsterdam Smart City. On the map you can see the location of these kits.
